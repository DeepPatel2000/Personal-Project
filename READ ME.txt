About:
This is my first project on MySQL, my friends and I host an anuual NBA Fantasy league. The following project is to showcase practical MySQL proficiency through the use of SQL queries to analyze NBA season data. The analysis identifies high-performing players and generates insights to inform strategy for the upcoming fantasy basketball season.

Instructions:
Turn raw Basketball-Reference per-game CSVs into a clean, query-ready **fantasy engine**:
- Normalized schema + staging pipeline
- Robust handling of `TOT / 2TM / 3TM / 4TM` rows (shows the player’s final team)
- Derived stats (e.g., **FG_Missed = FGA − FG**)
- Pluggable fantasy scoring via a **rules table**
- Leaderboards (PPG, per-minute, YoY breakouts) ready for dashboards

> **Tech**: SQL Server 2022, T-SQL, SSMS, `bcp`/Import Flat File  
> **Data**: Per-game player stats for 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25
